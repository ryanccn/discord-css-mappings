# `@discord-css-mappings/core`

The core package that powers Discord CSS Mappings.

This package exports a `getMappings` function that fetches CSS from Discord directly and creates mappings that can then be consumed by other tooling such as [the PostCSS plugin](https://npmjs.com/package/@discord-css-mappings/postcss-plugin).
